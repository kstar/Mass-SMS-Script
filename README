The purpose of this project is to enable mass sending of SMS
notifications to a phonebook without having an SMS gateway. This is
ideal for small volume messaging, with less than 1000 people, where
buying a gateway would be overkill.

The scripts invoke gnokii repeatedly to send SMS to each number in a
phone book. The scripts are error tolerant, in the sense that it does
not give up until the SMS is sent to a given number.
